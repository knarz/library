This repository contains fairly opinionated lists of resources for various
topics. The topics will be most likely very fuzzy and only serve as general
guidelines. Whenever possible, the entries will be accompanied by a short
justification as to why I consider them to be important.

If you feel that I did not add a resource you consider important then I would
appreciate a pull request.
